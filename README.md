# steets_test
Soluton for interview test at Steets


## Welcome to my solution
## 1. The code works in a way that it uses a custom-built encription
## 2. Entered year in the input results in calculating whether the year is prime, and checks for 30 additional prime years counting backwards from the entered year
## 3. The code finds the weekday for 25th december (christmass) for each prime year found
## 4. Then the words for the said days are encrypted and written in the database
## 5. The dataset is fetched from the database, the words for the days are decrypted and are displayed in the table
